# Address Book (Donna)

A simple commandâ€‘line address book application that lets users add, edit, search, display, sort, and delete contacts. This repository walks through two versions of the project, showcasing an arrayâ€‘based implementation (v1) and a linkedâ€‘list implementation (v2) with progressively improved sorting algorithms and data structures.

## Features

Both versions support:

1. **Add Contacts**: Insert new entries (name, phone, email).
2. **Display Contacts**: List all stored contacts.
3. **Search Contacts**: Lookup by name, phone number, or email.
4. **Update Contacts**: Modify existing entries.
5. **Delete Contacts**: Remove single or all contacts.
6. **Persistence**: Load from and save to a CSV file (`contacts.csv`).

Versionâ€‘specific sorting:

* **v1**: Sort by name, phone, or email using **bubble sort**.
* **v2**: Sort by name, phone, or email using **merge sort** on a dynamic linked list.

## Version History

### Version 1: Array + Bubble Sort

* **Data Structure**: Fixedâ€‘size array of `struct Record`.
* **Sorting**: Inâ€‘place bubble sort (`O(nÂ²)` time complexity).

#### Features

* Simple inâ€‘memory storage of contacts.
* Straightforward indexing by array position.
* Basic menuâ€‘driven interface.

#### Drawbacks

* **Fixed Capacity**: Maximum contacts limited by array size constant; adding beyond limit fails or overwrites.
* **Inefficient Sorting**: Bubble sort scales poorly for large data sets (worstâ€‘case `O(nÂ²)`).
* **Rigid Memory**: No dynamic allocationâ€”wastes space if underâ€‘utilized, cannot grow when needed.

---

### Version 2: Linked List + Merge Sort

* **Data Structure**: Singly linked list (`Node` structs allocated with `malloc`).
* **Sorting**: Topâ€‘down merge sort on the list (`O(n log n)` time complexity).

#### Enhancements Over v1

1. **Dynamic Sizing**: List grows or shrinks at runtime; no fixed limits.
2. **Efficient Sorting**: Merge sort dramatically reduces sort time on larger data.
3. **Duplicate Handling**: Supports multiple contacts with the same name; disambiguation in edit/delete flows.
4. **Flexible Search/Delete/Edit**: Search, edit, or delete by name, phone, or email with userâ€‘driven disambiguation when duplicates exist.
5. **Cleaner Memory Management**: Contacts freed correctly when deleted or on exit.

#### Drawbacks & Edge Cases

* **Fragmentation**: Non-contiguous memory may introduce overhead in very large lists.
* **Recursion Depth**: Merge sort recursion may hit stack limits on extremely large lists (millions of nodes).

## Drawbacks & Next Steps

* **Performance**: Further optimize search by adding indexing or a hash map.
* **Concurrency**: Add file locking for multiâ€‘process safety.
* **UI**: Migrate to a GUI or web interface for better usability.
* **Testing**: Integrate automated unit tests and CI pipeline.
